## Installation

### Globally
Install CLI globally with

```bash
$ npm install -g sequelize-cli-typescript
```

Now you can run CLI using following command anywhere

```bash
$ sequelize
```

### Locally
Install CLI locally to your `node_modules` folder with

```bash
$ npm install --save sequelize-cli-typescript
```

You should be able to run CLI with

```bash
$ node_modules/.bin/sequelize
```

### Differences from Sequelize-Cli _(non-TypeScript)_

With sequelize-cli, the ```model:generate``` command would produce _JavaScript_ files in two folders: 
/models and /migrations, or other folders as specified in your .sequelizerc file.  The ```db:migrate``` 
command would then exe ute these _JavaScript_ files to update your database.

With sequelize-cli-typescript, ```model:generate``` produces _TypeScript_ files in the same two folders
(or again, as specified in your .sequelizerc file).  But before you can run ```db:migrate``` you must
compile your migrations.  (The step of compiling your migrations is left to you.)

You could compile your migrations along with your other code, or as part of a separate script.  After you have compiled
your migrations, then you can run ```db:migrate```.

It's usually the case that the compiled _JavaScript_ code will be put in a different directory than
the source _TypeScript_ code, so whereas sequelize-cli had one ```migrations-path``` setting, 
sequelize-cli-typescript has two: ```migrations-source-path``` and ```migrations-compiled-path```, which
default to /migrations and /migrations/compiled respectively.
